              <p>Ramon Sanchez is a fascinating person with an interesting history that spans a variety of experiences. He studied play writing and song writing in college, and yet he can also build a PC computer from parts. He has been working as a substitute teacher in Los Angeles for a number of years, but during that time he also wrote a musical about vampires and a comedy about a psychedlic superhero.</p>
              <p>Ramon's special talents include playing guitar and piano. Though he might seem to be mostly creative and intellectual, he once replaced a clutch plate in a Ford Pinto. For nearly four years, he rode a motorcycle, which he bought while living in Berkeley, California. It was while he was living in Berkeley in an old Victorian house with painters, writers, musicians, and other creative people that Ramon first learned how to make web pages with only the HTML language. Around that time he was also acting in Shakespeare plays and directing a church choir.</p>
              <p>Ramon has been studying web development on and off for years, but recently increased his commitment to his studies. Currently, he is attending the UCLA Extension Boot Camp for full stack web development.</p>
